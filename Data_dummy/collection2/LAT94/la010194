 BUCKLE UP: The new bicycle helmet law for youngsters takes effect today. But 
that doesn't mean your child will be cited for forgetting. "We're going to 
educate the public first," says Fountain Valley police Lt. Robert Mosley. 
"We're going to have a six-month grace period where we'll just be issuing 
warnings." . . . Some local police departments will be spreading the word 
through flyers and programs at schools. But Mosley warns: "Kids need to follow 
the law."

 SMOKING MONEY: If you must smoke, the state of California is at least going to 
make it more expensive for you. The state tax on cigarettes goes up today, two 
cents per pack -- making it 37 cents. Will this deter smokers? Some Orange 
County vendors doubt it. Says a spokesman for a Circle K in Anaheim: "Right now 
we charge $2.30 a pack, including tax. But it wouldn't matter if we charged 
$2.50 or $2.80. It never stops someone who has to smoke." The tax boost is 
expected to raise an added $39 million a year for breast cancer research.

 HUSKER PARTY: Not all Cornhuskers will be at the Orange Bowl in Miami for the 
Nebraska-Florida State game. The University of Nebraska men's and women's swim 
teams are training at Corona del Mar High School for a Wednesday match with 
UCLA. Assistant Coach Kelly Long Nordell, a former Newport Harbor High swim 
star, is hosting all 47 of them at her parents' Newport Beach house tonight to 
watch the bowl game. "Nebraska does love its football," she says. "But we've 
got some pretty good swimmers too."

 WILL TRAVEL: UC Irvine Extension is bringing English-as-a-second-language 
training straight to the workplace, like office-delivered pizza. The Extension 
program has several courses, including Speech Improvement and English Grammar 
Review, that it will be teaching next year at business sites. . . . Says 
spokeswoman Loan Vo: "Orange County is becoming more diverse, and for 
foreign-born professionals working here, language training can be the key to 
advancement."

 MAJOR CRIME DROPS: While they dreamed of Hollywood stardom, athletic careers 
or quiet motherhood, most of the Valley's 128 homicide victims in 1993 died 
doing the banal: pumping gas, walking home from school, withdrawing money from 
a bank ATM. (A1) . . . The homicide rate dropped last year, along with robbery, 
burglary and aggravated assault, with only rape among major crimes increasing, 
according to projections.

<P>
 TOUCHDOWN DROUGHT: With only two touchdown catches in his four years as a 
tight end at UCLA, Brian Allen, who played at Hart High in Newhall, has lowered 
his expectations (C10) for today's Rose Bowl game. In his last game for the 
Bruins, he will settle for just one long run against Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
 POWER OF THE PRESS: Despite its location in small town Calabasas, the Jewish 
Spectator magazine has drawn the attention, and the writings, of prominent 
Jewish intellectuals. (B5) . . . And, because a majority of its 6,000 
subscribers are libraries and rabbis, its influence spreads wide and deep. But 
even this highbrow publication is not above a mention of Michael Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 LOOKING BACK: Steve Burdett, a race-car driver at Saugus Speedway, earned a 
surprising outpouring of support from his macho colleagues (C11) after he 
announced last summer that he was gay and had contracted the virus that causes 
AIDS. His courage and candor made him one of the Valley's most memorable sports 
personalities of 1993.

 WHO'S THE BOSS: The city of Lancaster has jumped into the landlord business, 
buying up mobile home parks as a way to preserve housing options for 
lower-income residents. The practice (B7) has been described as "pioneering" by 
some, although some mobile home residents suspect they are merely being wooed 
as voters. So far the city is the proud owner of two parks and talks are under 
way with the owners of three more. Valley Homicides

 The number of homicides has increased since 1991 in Devonshire and West Valley 
divisions of the LAPD. Homicides reported to the Valley Bureau, as of Dec. 7
